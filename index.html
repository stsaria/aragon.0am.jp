    <h1>Disappearance of Aragon</h1>
    <p>= R.I.P UltraKose And Aragonese people =</p>
    <pre>My time in Aragon seems long when I recall the events, but in the end it was short.
Aragon as a community was a very bad server,
It's hard to think about whether something like this should have a history.
But no longer, the history on Discord has been removed.
We're lucky if it's still there in direct messages.

Aragon was ravaged by someone.
It was also banned from access by all and all channels were wiped out.
EarthMC's early Aurora messages are, of course, no longer there.
Everything is gone, except the Wiki, Youtube, Discord direct messages and so on.</pre>
