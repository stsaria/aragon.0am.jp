            <h3>Welcome to EarthMC!</h3>
            <pre>
                Welcome to EMC!
                EMC uses gold ingots as its primary currency.
                There are two main ways to earn gold ingots in shops and various places in each country:

                <h4>1.Vote</h4>
                Voting is the easiest way to earn gold, and you can do it twice a day.
                How to do it:
                1.Type  /vote  in EMC
                2.Click the two links that appear
                3.Enter your MCID (Minecraft player name) on both sites and check the "I'm not a robot" box
                4.Wait 15 seconds on the second link site
                5.You will receive a Gold crate item, place it on the ground and open it
                6.Get gold!

                <h4>2.Mining</h4>
                Mining is the most efficient way to earn gold.

                Required items:
                These require a good amount of money there to get them,
                It is normal to not be able to prepare them when you are just starting out.
                It is recommended that you collect gold to get these items!

                1.Netherite or diamond pickaxe (Efficiency V, Unbreaking III, Mending + Silk Touch, Fortune is optional)
                2.Haste Potion (Level II)
                3.Food
                4.Shovel
                5.Experience

                <h5>How to do it:</h5>
                Never mine on your own land in town. The efficiency is too low.
                Mine outside of town, in a remote area with little human activity.
                Access the map at https://earthmc.net/map/aurora/ and look for an undeveloped area in Antarctica or the ocean. Teleport to a nearby country using  /n spawn country name .
                Once teleported, leave the town and go underground.

                Gold spawns anywhere below y-coordinate 22.
                However, lava appears below y-coordinate 16 and deepslate below y-coordinate 0, which slows down mining. It is recommended to mine between y17 and y22. (This does not apply if you are mining underwater and emerge into the ocean.)
                Once you reach y17~y22, drink the potion and start mining!
                The combination of the potion and Efficiency V enchantment allows you to instantly break stones, so you can mine quickly.
                The most efficient mining method is to dig diagonally at a width of 4 blocks and a height of 2 blocks.
                Swing your mouse slowly to dig wide.
                When you find gold ore, mine it. Since gold ore often spawns diagonally, dig around it a bit.

                When your pickaxe's durability decreases, it's time for Mending and experience.
                Type  /bottle store max  to create a single experience bottle that absorbs all your experience.
                Hold the pickaxe with Mending in your offhand and throw the experience bottle at yourself to repair it.

            <h5>Tips:</h5>
                You can smelt the gold ore you get, but shops like yamato and mali will buy it for 1g (1 gold ingot).
                This means you can convert gold ore to gold ingots.
                It is recommended to save time.

                You can also shop at shops with gold ingots in your Ender Chest.
                In this case, it will be automatically withdrawn from the Ender Chest.
                This system is called a bank.

                If you have extra gold, please donate it to the town you joined!
                type /t spawn to teleport to spawn point and type  /t deposit amount  to complete the donation.

                Enjoy EMC! If you have any questions, please ask on Discord.
