<pre>We strongly denounce Mr. UltraMakoto_ for his misguided decision to betray us and declare that we will never make concessions to the traitor and the Mongols who aided him.
He has turned against UltraKose for personal reasons and has colluded with our enemies, the Mongols, to take 443g of gold and many other items from Beni_mellal, with whom he had nothing to do.
In addition to this, he has abandoned dialogue by blocking me and other Aragonese officials on discord.

Propaganda video released by Mongolia showing the collusion between Mongolia and UltraMakoto_.

Saadi and Aragon declares war on Mongolia
Pelotage, King of Mongolia, yesterday in Wilderness near Numidia, a town in Aragon, our best ally,
He PKed UltraRaid, Makoto_324, and UltraKose, King of Aragon, and took a number of items.

The Mongolian officials are former Spanish officials who have repeatedly and unjustly attacked and discriminated against Aragon,
We will never forget their crimes.
In addition, the recent attacks in Numidia have underscored our position on Mongolia.

Saadi and Aragon have declared Mongolia an enemy and will henceforth oppose it by any means necessary.

Yue, another country located in East Asia, has also been unjustly invaded by Mongolia and has already declared war on Mongolia.
Mongolia plans to invade Yue with overclaims and that Yue will defend itself with shields,
Mongolia demanded that Yue compensate them for the damage caused by the failed invasion.
We fully support Yue's position on this matter.

Glory to Saadi!
Glory to Aragon Federation!
